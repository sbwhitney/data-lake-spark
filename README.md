# data-lake-spark
Udacity Data Engineer Nanodegree


Our music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown our user base and song database even more and want to move the data warehouse to a data lake. The data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in the app.

As the data engineering team, we are tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts data from S3, processes them using Spark, and loads the data back into S3 as a set of dimensional tables. This will allow the analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs our users are listening to.

We'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to us by the analytics team and compare our results with their expected results.

# Project Description


In this project, we'll apply Spark to build an ETL pipeline for a data lake hosted on S3. We will load data from S3, process the data into analytics tables using Spark, and load them back into S3. This Spark process will be deployed on a cluster using AWS.

# Song Dataset

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

`{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}`

# Log Dataset

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset we'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```

1. Run `etl.py` to process the entire datasets.
